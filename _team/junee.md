Hello! My name is Junee Omana, and I’m a rising junior pursuing Electrical Engineering on the Integrated Circuits and Electronics pathway at Colorado School of Mines. This summer, I’m working with Prof. Martinez in the SHRED Lab to redesign the circuitry of the RoboLoom, a robotic Jacquard loom. Our goal is to optimize its design so it can function more effectively as a manufacturing tool for medical applications. Through my time in the RISS program, I’m excited to explore the intersection of my passion for sustainability and the rapidly advancing field of robotics. I’m especially interested in how embedded systems and intelligent hardware can be designed for both performance and environmental responsibility. In the future, I hope to continue developing technologies that enhance people’s quality of life while reducing their ecological impact.
