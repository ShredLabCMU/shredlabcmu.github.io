<!-- Will Scott is a community-oriented roboticist, educator, design scholar, and social critic pursuing a Master of Human-Computer Interaction who explores the integration of robotics with education and artistic disciplines. His work centers on equity, culture, and technical literacy to uplift innovations from marginalized groups to support the exploration of their identity through culturally relevant making that promotes their sustained engagement in the S.T.E.A.M. field. He works to design software systems, build curricula, and facilitate programs to educate underrepresented youth about robotics, entrepreneurship, and art in a safe, inclusive environment where we deepen our collective understanding of epistemological pluralism around historically "feminized" fields of study.Will Scott is a community-oriented roboticist, educator, design scholar, and social critic working in the Social Haptics Robotics and Education (SHRED) Lab who explores the integration of robotics with education and artistic disciplines.

My expertise lies in constructing firmware systems, developing software applications, and designing user interfaces. Applying my education and technical expertise has led me to actively conduct educational initiatives within my local communities to ensure that technical advances are shared and provide equity for all.

Community engagement is my passion- married with my expertise in technology- I find purpose and motivation to envision a more inclusive and creative world. Being a young and highly motivated computer engineer, researcher, and design scholar has enabled me to experience working on various projects throughout my career, giving me a depth of experience in the field of robotics and human-computer interactions.
