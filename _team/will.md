Will graduated from the University of Pittsburgh this year with a B.S. in Computer Engineering. His primary focus surrounds community-oriented robotics, integrating robotics with education. He performs research and community engagement initiatives in the Social Haptics Robotics and Education Laboratory under the guidance of Dr. Melisa Martinez. Will thrives in collaborative team-oriented   environments.   
As   a   Promoting   Emerging   Entrepreneurs   in   Robotics   (PEER) fellow, Will looks forward to refining his communication skills and building his professional network with like-minded peers. He cannot wait to use the technical knowledge and skills to empower his local community: building frameworks for after-school programs and community workshops   designed   to   expose   underrepresented   minorities   to   robotic   concepts   in   a   safe
environment.
