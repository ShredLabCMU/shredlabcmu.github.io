Will Scott is a community-oriented roboticist, educator, design scholar, and social critic pursuing a Master of Human-Computer Interaction who explores the integration of robotics with education and artistic disciplines. His work centers on equity, culture, and technical literacy to uplift innovations from marginalized groups to support the exploration of their identity through culturally relevant making that promotes their sustained engagement in the S.T.E.A.M. field. He works to design software systems, build curricula, and facilitate programs to educate underrepresented youth about robotics, entrepreneurship, and art in a safe, inclusive environment where we deepen our collective understanding of epistemological pluralism around historically "feminized" fields of study.Will Scott is a community-oriented roboticist, educator, design scholar, and social critic working in the Social Haptics Robotics and Education (SHRED) Lab who explores the integration of robotics with education and artistic disciplines.
