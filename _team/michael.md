Hello, this is Woongseok Han. I go by Michael as well. I am a Master student in Mechanical Engineering Department and I am interested in Haptic Robotics. During my undergraduate research, I worked on a lower body physical Human Robot Interaction device. Currently, I am working on a Haptic device which lets the user experience haptic feedback through a robotic computer mouse to enhance the learning ability of the user.
