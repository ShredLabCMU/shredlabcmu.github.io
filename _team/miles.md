I am an entrepreneur with a passion for creating user-friendly products that promote community and well-being. Currently, as a Robotics Institute Pathways Fellow, I'm focused on advancing my startupâ€™s **Relai** physical product (*Exchange Zones*) by studying mechatronic design principles and their applications to everyday wellness and behaviors.  

My work draws on a diverse background in business and technology, including experience as **Co-Founder and Founding Engineer** of *35th Street Builders (3SB)*, where I led a team that provided transparency and sustainability when creating software products for non-technical teams. I am especially interested in the intersection of engineering, design, and human-centered innovation.
