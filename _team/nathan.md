Nathan earned his BS in Mechanical Engineering from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2016 where he was a bronze tablet award winner. During his undergraduate studies, he participated in several internships in structural testing and analysis at GE Aviation and Boeing. After graduation, he continued to work as a structural test, analysis, and instrumentation engineer on NASAâ€™s Artemis program and then as a mechanical designer for a Boeing Flight Simulation Lab.

He began his Ph.D. program in Fall 2022 in the LeDuc Lab to explore biohybrid robotic systems. In 2024, he gave a platform talk at the Biophysical Society Conference, titled "A Biohybrid Mechanosensor Integrated with a Soft Robot", which elaborated on several lab efforts to incorporate cellular sensing into robotic systems. He also is participating with biologists at the University of Pittsburgh as part of a TL1 grant to study the effects of mechanical stress on kidney cells.
