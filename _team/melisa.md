I am an Assistant Professor in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, where I lead the Social Haptics Robotics and Education (SHRED) Laboratory.

My research combines the areas of robotics, haptics, human-computer interaction, and education. My main areas of focus and interest are developing low-cost, open-source robotic technology for educational applications and understanding the effects of this technology on learning; as well as studying the sense of touch and developing novel mechanisms for human-machine interaction.
