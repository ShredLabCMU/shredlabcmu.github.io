I am deeply passionate about robotics and automation. My journey began with a love for designing and creating, which led me to start a Battle Bots project at the University of Pittsburgh through the Robotics and Automation Society. This experience has honed my skills in designing intricate mechanisms and using CAD software to bring ideas to life. I am committed to giving back to the community and give talks to high school students about robotics, aiming to inspire the next generation of engineers and innovators. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can apply my expertise in robotics to solve complex challenges. Let's connect and explore how we can innovate together!
