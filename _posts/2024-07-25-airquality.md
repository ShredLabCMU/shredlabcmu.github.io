## Motivation
We understand the city of Pittsburgh along with the greater Pittsburgh area has historically suffered from poor/hazardous air quality conditions, stemming from the prolific rise and fall of the US steel industry. However, despite previous economic initiatives to rectify the air quality of the region, we acknowledge the active ongoing harm to our neighborhood communities by the U.S. Steel facilities known as the Clairton Coke Works and the Irvin and Edgar Thomson steel mills [1]. We are motivated to empower our youth to learn fundamental engineering and software concepts to develop a cluster of air-quality monitoring units to better assess, record, and understand their built environment to make more informed decisions on their health and safety.
