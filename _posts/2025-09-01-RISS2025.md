Congratulations to the RISS 2025 Cohort! This summer’s scholars presented their research projects to the Carnegie Mellon University research community, RISS Sponsors, and the Pittsburgh public during the 2025 RISS Closing Celebration on August 7.

We were very fortunate to host a record number of 6 students in our lab this summer.

This summer was very special as RISS was thrilled to initiate a partnership with University of Guadalajara (UDG), Mexico. We welcomed four scholars from Mexico, all who joined the SHRED Lab during the summer, three of whom are students at UDG. The University of Guadalajara is Mexico’s second-largest public university, serving more than 300,000 students and supported by a robust faculty of over 15,000 members across multiple campuses. We look forward to continuing to unite our research communities through this partnership!

We were honored to welcome Dr. Marco Pérez-Cisneros to join us at the RISS Closing and Poster Session! Dr. Marco is a professor and the Rector of the CUCEI at UDG, and he came to join us in congratulating three 2025 RISS Scholars from University of Guadalajara– Atziri Daniela Diego Gonzalez, Juan Pablo Robles Perez, and Denisse Arlene Reyes Rosas– for completing their summer research! Dr. Marco is not only an accomplished scholar and tech researcher, but is an incredible advocate for his students. Thank you also to the Rector of the University of Guadalajara, Mtra. Karla Alejandrina Planter Pérez, and all of their colleagues at UDG for their dedication to advocacy and mentorship as they help launch the next global generation of roboticists and AI Scholars. We are proud to welcome Dr. Marco, along with his colleagues and scholars, into the RISS Family!

We would also like to acknowledge the help of Rachel Burcin, Global Programs Manager and Co-director of RISS for her help and support to our talented students.
