Haptic Guidance Robot

Haptic Guidance Robot research objective is to understand bidirectional nonverbal communications between humans and robots through haptic modalities for guidance purposes. The project aims to build a full-sized guidance robot with a variety of haptic sensors and actuators, and perform studies with human subjects, particularly the visually impaired people, for performance and design evaluation of effective guidance tasks.

The Haptic Guidance Robot project researches human-robot interaction through the sense of touch. The robot uses haptic modalities for guidance purposes for the visually impaired community.
