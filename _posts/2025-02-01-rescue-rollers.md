Rescue Rollers are centimeter scale robots designed to operate in unstructured environments for search and rescue. We are exploring how we can achieve robust locomotion with robots of this size after natural disasters. By leveraging their size and a suite of sensing capabilities, a swarm of Rescue Rollers can help first-responders safely and efficiently locate and recover survivors. Rescue Rollers are also part of a symbiotic system with vine robots. They provide steering and enhanced sensing capabilities, while the vine robots allow for efficient large scale locomotion and power for the centi-robots.
