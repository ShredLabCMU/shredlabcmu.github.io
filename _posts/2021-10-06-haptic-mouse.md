Haptic Mouse is a prototype of a mouse that uses touch feedback to render digital graphical content for blind and low-vision users.  Our intent is to develop an open-source tool that aids blind and low-vision students in learning abstract concepts that are hard to grasp without visualizations.  Through our device, students can dynamically interact with abstract concepts such as mathematical functions, physical and chemical equations, among others using their sense of touch.

        We have designed a mouse capable of rendering rich haptic effects through a delta mechanism which replaces the standard mouse button.
