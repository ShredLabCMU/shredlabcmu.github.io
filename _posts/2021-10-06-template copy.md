Blind and low vision STEM education is hindered by an inability to engage with visual representations of STEM concepts. Our sense of touch provides us with a separate, distributed channel that could allow us to convey abstract STEM concepts non-visually. We propose using robot-mediated haptics to enable blind and low vision students to engage in STEM education through hands-on, interactive learning.
