HaptiClay, a low-cost kinesthetic haptic interface that elevates the understanding of mathematics language by providing embodied non-verbal representations of math concepts. 
Our interface integrates four key components: a haptic device, a high-level simulation that communicates with a low-level controller for force and position updates, a low-level controller that executes the feedback from the simulation, and a visualization system that provides visual feedback corresponding to the haptic input.
