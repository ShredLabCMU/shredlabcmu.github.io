abstract = {Haptic surfaces can convey substantial tactile information, benefiting diverse applications such as robotic teleoperation, medical simulation, virtual reality (VR), and education. A critical challenge in haptic device technology is generating haptic sensations associated with mechanical compliance. Employing soft materials for adaptable interfaces that dynamically alternate between soft and hard tactile feedback further complicates this challenge. In this study, we address stiffness-controlled feedback through the design and fabrication of magnetically actuatable micro-structures using a UV-curable magnetic elastomer. These micro-structures, covered by a thin magnetic elastomer layer, form a pad that functions as an encounter-type haptic display when magnetically stimulated. User evaluations demonstrated clear differentiation in perceived softness, confirming the effectiveness of the designed haptic interface.},

abstract = {A miniature haptic stimulation device utilizes focused ultrasound to deliver a tactile haptic sensation to the finger. The 1-3 piezocomposite device has a 1 cm 2 footprint, which is an order of magnitude smaller than other ultrasonic haptic devices and is a good candidate for wearable tactile rendering systems. The device focuses energy to a 1 mm 3 voxel. The current prototype was validated with a small, preliminary human subject study and requires an average input voltage of 68.8 V to elicit tactile sensation. The sensory drive voltage threshold will decrease with future refinement of mechanical impedance matching and focusing.},

abstract = {Weaving is a fabrication process that is grounded in mathematics and engineering: from the binary, matrix-like nature of the pattern drafts weavers have used for centuries, to the punch card programming of the first Jacquard looms. This intersection of disciplines provides an opportunity to ground abstract mathematical concepts in a concrete and embodied art, viewing this textile art through the lens of engineering. Currently, available looms are not optimized to take advantage of this opportunity to increase mathematics learning by providing hands-on interdisciplinary learning in collegiate classrooms. In this work, we present SPEERLoom: an open-source, robotic Jacquard loom kit designed to be a tool for interweaving cloth fabrication, mathematics, and engineering to support interdisciplinary learning in the classroom. We discuss the design requirements and subsequent design of SPEERLoom. We also present the results of a pilot study in a post-secondary class finding that SPEERLoom supports hands-on, interdisciplinary learning of math, engineering, and textiles.},
